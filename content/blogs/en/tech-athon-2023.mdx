[dr Krzysztof Dudziński](https://sdp.legal/team/krzysztof-dudzinski) Partner at SDP was the mentor during the Tech-Athon 2023 edition.

„Engineers for the Society" Tech-Athon 2023 is an organized marathon of work on own research ideas submitted by teams of PhD students. The event is organized yearly by  [Politechnika Warszawska](https://www.linkedin.com/company/warsaw-university-of-technology/)  (Warsaw University of Technology) in form of a team competition.

Doctoral students form teams, work on their innovative solutions for society, present concepts and the best ones receive funding to implement demonstrators. The total amount of funding is up to PLN400,000, which, at this level, offers many opportunities. It is a chance for them to try co-working and a great opportunity to stimulate creativity.

The jury distinguished 5 teams. The first place (ex aequo) went to the QPI4MED team and the Pd Med team. Third place went to the Hydrogenius team. The jury awarded two honorable awards to the PulseLayers and 3D Hand teams.

The goal of the project is to develop solution prototype concepts by WUT doctoral students in the areas of biomedical engineering, photonic technology, cyber security and data analysis and energy conversion and storage.

The competition is mentored by practitioners in the field of new technologies, start-up owners and IP lawyers.

Congratulations to all the winners and participants!
