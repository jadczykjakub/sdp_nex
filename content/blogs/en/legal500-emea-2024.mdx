We are pleased to announce that SDP has been listed in the prestigious Legal500 EMEA 2024 ranking for the second year in a row! 

We were recognised among the best Polish IP law firms in Tier 4. 

Some of the recommendations we have received during the research:
‘They are very knowledgeable, easy to work with and very responsive. I usually receive a reply within a few hours.’

‘SDP’s strongest point is its individual approach to the client and the transparency of its recommendations.’

‘Krzysztof Dudziński is a very good and very proactive trade mark attorney. He does not just report and summarise facts, but he provides professional advice which is always very useful. He drafts contracts very thoughtfully and is successful when negotiating terms of a coexistence agreement.’

Thank you to everyone supporting our work – our clients, partners, employees and friends!
